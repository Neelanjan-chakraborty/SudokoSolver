Install Python: Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org) and follow the installation instructions.

Install required packages: Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to install the required packages:

Copy code
pip install flask flask_cors
Run the server: In the command prompt or terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to start the Flask server:

Copy code
python app.py
This will start the server on http://localhost:5000.

Test the API using cURL: Open a new command prompt or terminal window and run the following cURL commands to interact with the API:

To start a new Sudoku game:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/start
To make a move on the Sudoku board:

swift
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"row\": 0, \"col\": 0, \"num\": 5}" http://localhost:5000/move
You can modify the values in the JSON payload (row, col, num) to make moves on different cells.

Note: Make sure the server is running (app.py) before making these API calls.

Test the GUI (optional): If you want to test the GUI interface, you can run the run.bat file. This will open the GUI application, allowing you to interact with the Sudoku solver visually.

Note: The GUI relies on the Flask server being running in the background.

That's it! You have successfully deployed the Sudoku solver application and tested it using cURL commands and the GUI interface. You can now customize and enhance the application as needed.
